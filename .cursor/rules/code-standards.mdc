# Code Standards for the Monkeybun Backend Service

- Use uv for package management.
- Do not tightly couple dependencies in classes. Always use dependency injection when you can.
- If a module has dependencies, they should be in the dependency file for that module.
- Do not write comments or docstrings for functions and classes.
- Do not write comments unless absolutely necessary to explain something that is not obvious.
- Do not create markdown files to explain your changes unless I ask you to do so.
- Do not create **init**.py files.
- Keep the postman collection up to date with the code.
