# Style Guide for the Monkeybun Backend Service

- Do not write comments or docstrings for functions and classes.
- Do not write comments unless absolutely necessary to explain something that is not obvious.
- Do not create markdown files to explain your changes unless I ask you to do so.
- Do not create **init**.py files.
